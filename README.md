   - Handles division by zero gracefully.

3. **Multiplication Table Generator**
   - Generates the multiplication table for a user-provided number (1 to 10).

4. **Drawing Patterns with Nested Loops**
   - Prompts for a positive integer and prints a square pattern of asterisks (`*`) of that size.

5. **Personal Daily Reminder**
